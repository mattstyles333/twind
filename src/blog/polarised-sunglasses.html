      Ah, the great British summer. One minute you're basking in glorious sunshine, the next you're huddled under an umbrella. But when the sun does make an appearance, you want to be ready.

<!-- What Are Polarised Sunglasses? -->

      What Are Polarised Sunglasses?

    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      Picture this: you're driving down the motorway, the sun's glaring off the bonnet of the car in front, and you're squinting so hard you look like you're trying to read the fine print on a contract. That's where polarised sunglasses come in. They're not just fancy marketing speak - they're genuinely different from your run-of-the-mill sunnies.

      Understanding Polarised Lenses
    </h5>
    <h6 class="text-left text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4">
      What Does Polarised Mean?
    </h6>
    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      No, it's not about being opinionated! In the world of optics, polarisation is all about light waves. When light bounces off a flat surface, it becomes 'polarised' - meaning the reflected light waves all travel in the same direction. This is what causes that annoying glare that makes you wish you'd stayed indoors.
    </p>
    <h6 class="text-left text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-gray-300 mt-8">
      How Do Polarised Lenses Work?
    </h6>
    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      Think of polarised lenses as bouncers at a very exclusive light wave club. They only let in the cool, well-behaved light waves and block out the rowdy, glare-causing ones. The result? A clearer, more comfortable view of the world.
