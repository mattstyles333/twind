        </a>
        <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">This coating eliminates surface reflections on a
            lens,
            enabling more light transmission, enhancing vision, reducing eye strain, and improving the aesthetics of
            glasses.
            An anti-reflective coat also enhances driver safety by minimizing glare from streetlights or headlights,
            leading
            to faster recognition of road hazards, especially at night.
