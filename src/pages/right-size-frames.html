        The right size frames
      </h2>
      <p class="mx-auto mt-8 max-w-7xl text-center text-lg leading-loose">
        With thousands of frames to choose from, how do you choose a pair of
        glasses that will fit correctly? On this page, you'll learn two methods
        for choosing a great-fitting frame, without having to try them on first.
        These tips are extremely handy if you are considering purchasing your
        next pair of glasses on the internet. If you do decide to buy online, it
        is advisable to choose a supplier that offers an exchange or return
        service, just in case!

          <p class="text-center leading-loose text-gray-700">
            The number on the left-hand side of the square box is the "Eye Size"
            and is sometimes referred to as the "A" measurement. This is the
            width of the lens at its widest point measured in millimetres (see A
            in the diagram below).

          <p class="text-center leading-loose text-gray-700">
            The number on the right-hand side of the square box is the "Bridge
            Width" and is sometimes referred to as the "DBL" (distance between
            lenses). This is the distance between the two lenses measured in
            millimetres.

            You may also find a third, three-digit number. This is the "Arm
            Length". The arm length is measured in millimetres from the
            attachment screw to the tip of the arm. The measurement is made
            before the bend is put into the arm.

        Two methods for choosing a good-fitting frame.
      </h2>

      <!-- Method 1 -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl font-medium">
          Method 1: Using Eye Size & Bridge Size
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          In many cases, you can achieve great results by comparing the Eye Size
          and Bridge Size to your existing frames. However, bear in mind the
          Bridge Size is not really the "size of the bridge that fits you",
          think of it simply as the distance between the two lenses on any
          particular style.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          Aviator styles, where the lenses meet very close towards the brow of
          the frame, have a very small bridge size with a wider eye size yet
          these can fit just as well as a more traditional style with a smaller
          eye size and wider bridge.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Method 2 -->
      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl font-medium">
          Method 2: Using Total Width (Preferred Method)
        </h3>
        <p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          Another method is comparing the total width of the frames. By
          comparing the Total Width measurement of your existing frames to those
          displayed online, you can achieve much better results. That being
          said, not all online suppliers will display the Total Width of each
          individual frame as it needs to be physically measured and is not
          generally not given by the frame manufacturers. If this is the case
          you can revert to the previous method.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          To measure the Total Width of your existing glasses place the frames
          on a flat surface with the arms opened. Place a ruler on top and at
          the front of the frame measure the outside edge of the left temple
          piece to the outside edge of the right temple piece on millimetres.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-2 leading-relaxed">
          When choosing your new glasses you may select a frame with a Total
          Width measurement within 2 to 3 millimetres. Here at Spex4less, you
          can filter any category page by Total Width and the results shown will
          be within 2 millimetres of the width that you select.
        </p>
        <p class="leading-relaxed">
          We recommend using the Total Width measurement where possible and
          reverting to method 1 when the total width is not available. As in
          Method 1, the Arm length can be used as a secondary consideration.

        <h3 class="mb-2 text-xl font-semibold">Lens Depth</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          You may have noticed that thus far, we have not mentioned the Lens
          Depth. This measurement will largely depend on the style of frame you
          decide upon and in many cases, is not required to identify a
          good-fitting frame. However, if you are choosing glasses for Bifocals
          or Varifocals, be mindful that the shallower the frame is, the less
          area there will be available for the reading element of your lens.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
          When purchasing Varifocals we recommend a Lens Depth of at least 27
          millimetres. For this reason, at Spex4Less, Varifocal lenses will not
          be available to purchase on frames with a lens depth of fewer than 27
          millimetres.
