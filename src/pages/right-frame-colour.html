        Choosing The Right Colour Frames
      </h2>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Choosing new <a href="/glasses" class="text-link">glasses</a> is a big
        deal. They are a statement accessory that becomes part of your identity.
        The colour of your frames can make a huge difference to your whole look.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        When choosing a pair of frames, you should think about finding a colour
        that either complements or contrasts against your hair colour, eye
        colour and skin tone.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        There is no right or wrong way to pick the right frame colour, as long
        as you feel beautiful and confident in what you're wearing.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        With that said, our handy guide will help you find out which frames will
        work best with your look and personality, and make choosing your perfect
        glasses easier than ever!

      <!-- Complexion Section -->
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Choosing a Frame to Match Your Complexion
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Light Skin Tone –</strong> Cool skin with pink undertones look
        best with similar cool hues such as silver, grey, blue and clear. A pale
        peachy complexion with yellow undertones pairs well with warm neutrals,
        and dark colours like brown, gold, pink and purple.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Medium skin tone –</strong> Neutral skin types with a mix of
        pink and golden undertones can wear just about anything. Go bold with
        stark black, shine with neutrals, or play with any number of fun shades
        including red, purple, green, blue or gold.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Deep Skin Tone –</strong> Warm skin with golden undertone, are
        complemented best with similarly warm frames like tortoiseshell, brown,
        red, orange, gold, and yellow shades. They also look great with the
        boldness of all black.
      </p>

      <!-- Eye Colour Section -->
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Choosing a Frame to Match Your Eye Colour
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Brown/Hazel Eyes -</strong> Pair well with warmer tones like
        tortoiseshells, golds, and greens. If you want to stand out, choose a
        bold colour that contrasts against brown, like a bright green or a cool
        blue.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Blue Eyes -</strong> Pair beautifully with blue and grey tones.
        They also contrast well with rich browns and tortoiseshell. For a bold
        look, orange will really make your eyes pop.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Green Eyes -</strong> Pair well with brown and earthy tones.
        They also contrast nicely with pink or purple hues. If you want to make
        a statement, red frames will bring a vibrant contrast and gold or purple
        hues will also have a striking effect.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Grey eyes -</strong> Pair really well with colourful frames to
        bring a bright finish to your look. Because grey is already a neutral
        tone, almost any bright colour will work with grey eyes.
      </p>

      <!-- Hair Colour Section -->
      <h3 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">
        Choosing a Frame to Match Your Hair Colour
      </h3>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Black Hair -</strong> Pairs with a multitude of colours. Dark
        frames like black or tortoiseshell look especially sleek with black
        hair. Alternatively, bright colours will bring a sharp contrast, which
        is great for a statement-making finish.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Red Hair –</strong> Looks especially vibrant with bold frames in
        strong hues. Experiment with rich, jewel-toned colours, or, for a more
        conventional look, go with darker frames in reddish browns, gold and
        copper.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Brown Hair –</strong> Brown with red undertones match perfectly
        with tortoiseshell frames and warm, earthy tones, such as amber or dark
        green. Brown with ashy undertones pair well with dark frames, especially
        black. You can also experiment with light-toned glasses with clear
        frames or pastel colours.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Blonde Hair –</strong> If you have warm undertones in your
        blonde hair, choose frames in warm shades such as light tortoiseshell,
        peach, forest green, or dark brown. Ash tones or platinum blonde hair
        looks especially striking with pastels and bright colours.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>White/Grey Hair -</strong> The ultimate neutral pallet, making
        it great for experimenting with different looks. Neutral frames will
        look effortlessly stylish, while strong, bright colours such as cherry
        red, sea blue or a black will add a pop of contrast to your look.
