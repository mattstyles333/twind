        <h2 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-semibold">STEP 1: Choose Your Frame</h2>
        <p class="text-base leading-loose">
          Your frame should reflect your unique style and personality. At
          Spex4Less, our vast collection extends from timeless aviators and
          wayfarers to modern cat-eyes and geometric designs. Beyond shape,
          selecting the right frame colour can elevate your look, whether you're
          going for subtle neutrals or bold hues. Moreover, while comfort is
          essential, it's the precise measurements that make all the difference.
          Ensuring the glasses fit just right hinges on choosing the perfect
          dimensions, which will naturally complement the contours of your face.
          Whether your face is round, square, oval, or heart-shaped, we have the
          ideal frame size and colour to highlight your best features. Our
          assortment spans budget-friendly stock frames to luxurious designer
          selections. Embark on your eyewear journey and discover your ideal
          match today!

        <p class="text-lg leading-loose">
          A frame is not just about style; the lenses you choose play a pivotal
          role in your comfort and vision clarity. Our extensive lens catalogue
          ensures that you get the best in class, whether it's polycarbonate,
          trivex, or high-index lenses. Enhance your user experience by opting
          for advanced coatings that resist smudge, reduce glare, and protect
          against UV rays.
