          which varies from country to country. And we do not add tax to any
          amount shown in your basket.

          It is important to note that while safety and sportswear may enhance
          performance, the materials are designed to offer a degree of impact
          resistance but are not unbreakable. Lenses used in sports eyewear are
          designed to protect and improve the safety of your eyes while
          participating in sports. Although polycarbonate and other sports
          lenses have a high degree of impact resistance, this does not mean
          that they are unbreakable or that you will not suffer any injury while
          wearing them. Of course, nothing in these terms excludes or limits our
          liability for death or personal injury which arises from our
          negligence or any breach of our statutory duty.

          The information regarding frame dimensions is as accurate as possible.
          Some frame dimensions rely on data supplied by the manufacturer. From
          time-to-time batches of frames supplied to us may have slight
          variations in size. This is why sizes specified are nominal in order
          to allow for such variance if they occur and should be used as a
          guideline for fitting purposes.

          other than faulty frames or lenses must be in their original condition

          availability of this service is at the discretion of the company.
          Where we agree to a frame trial, we will take a payment upfront for
          the products, typically a proportion of the cost advertised on our
          website. The trial frame(s) must be returned to us within one week, at
          your own cost and risk (we recommend using a tracked service for your
          own peace of mind). Upon receipt of the frame(s) back at Spex4less,
          you will be given the following options so long as the frame(s) and
          packaging are in perfect resaleable condition:
        </li>

          on our website at the time you confirm and pay for your order.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 list-decimal text-lg leading-relaxed">
          2. A full refund of your trial frame(s) payment, less our shipping
          charges for sending the frame(s) out to you.

        <li class="mt-3 list-decimal text-lg leading-relaxed">
          3. A credit of the trial frame(s) payment against any other purchase
          at Spex4less. Where the cost of such a purchase is less than the trial
          frame(s) payment, the difference will be refunded to you.

          divulged to another party. This protection and ethos is also
          encompassed within current law and a new regulation in force from May
          25, 2018. The new regulation is called the General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR).
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 list-decimal text-lg leading-relaxed">
          The two fundamental objectives of the GDPR are to:
          <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li>
              give citizens and residents back control of their personal data;
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              simplify the regulatory environment for international business by
              unifying the regulation within the EU.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 list-decimal text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Under the new legislation, the Spex4less’s data controllers must
          ensure personal data is processed lawfully, transparently, and for a
          specific purpose. Once that purpose is fulfilled and the data is no
          longer required, it should be deleted. As a customer, you will let us
          know if you no longer wish to keep the information we hold for you.
          This information may take many forms from contact details to
          prescriptions, notes & information you have provided and orders you
          have made. Spex4less will be intent on following and exceeding the
          requirements of this new regulation. One of the most important
          elements of the new regulation is that we are not allowed to use your
          information without your very specific permission to do so.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 list-decimal text-lg leading-relaxed">
          For further clarity, article 5 of the GDPR stipulates the following
          with regards to how personal data is treated:
          <ol class="mt-2 list-decimal pl-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            <li>
              processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation
              to individuals;
            </li>
            <li>
              collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not
              further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those
              purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public
              interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
              statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible
              with the initial purposes;
            </li>
            <li>
              adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to
              the purposes for which they are processed;
            </li>
            <li>
              accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable
              step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are
              inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are
              processed, are erased or rectified without delay;
            </li>
            <li>
              kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for
              no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the
              personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for
              longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed
              solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
              or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to
              implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational
              measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and
              freedoms of individuals;
            </li>
            <li>
              processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the
              personal data, including protection against unauthorised or
              unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or
              damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
