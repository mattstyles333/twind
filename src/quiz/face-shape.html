              Small oval frames will soften the angular lines of your face.

              For men, try a metal rectangular frame to contrast your facial

            </li>
            <li>
              For women, try a cat-eye frame that angles towards the top corner

            </li>

            Heart-shaped faces have a broad forehead and wide cheekbones that

              Frames that are wider at the top than the bottom will add width to

              Try light-coloured or rimless frames for something subtle that

              Frames that are heavily accented on the top with detailing and

            <li>
              Glasses with a wide or bold brow line will draw attention away
              from your jawline and elongate your forehead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Glasses that are darker on top and lighter at the bottom, such as

            People with oval faces suit most frame shapes. Oval faces are

              Cat-eye glasses have the ability to add length to your face.

              Sharper edges create angles and have a flattering effect. Choose
              styles with bold, angular details and clean lines.

        Keep in mind that there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to
