        1. THE MOST IMPORTANT TERM
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        Your sight is very important and there are circumstances where you
        should not buy prescription glasses online: Under 16. If you are under
        16 you should only be dispensed with glasses under the direct
        supervision of a Registered Optician. If your prescription is over 2
        years old (1 year for over 70's) or your Optometrist has recommended an
        earlier sight test then you must have another sight test in order to
        have an up to date prescription before ordering.

        3. SUPPLY OF GOODS
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        You can make an order via our website. We will always try our best to
        ensure that all orders are fulfilled. However occasionally items might
        be out of stock or exceptionally might have been recently discontinued.
        In this case we will contact you. Although you will receive a
        confirmation email that your order has arrived, orders for prescription
        glasses are only accepted by us once they have been fully reviewed and
        authorised by a Registered Optician. We may need to contact you to
        discuss any concerns that we might have about your prescription. We may
        offer advice over the telephone or by email.
      </p>

        4. DELIVERY
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        We will work on your order as soon as it is received. To give you an
        idea of delivery times please see below: Frames and single vision lenses
        in our immediate stock are usually dispatched in 1-3 days. Bifocal and
        non stock lenses are usually dispatched within a week but can take up to
        14 days. Varifocals take longer because we need to post the frame to you
        first for measurement.

        5. PRIVACY POLICY
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        We collect data for the purpose of processing orders, contacting
        customers, and collecting feedback. As such, we will sometimes need to
        pass on data to third party data processors, for example passing your
        delivery address

        7. GUARANTEE/REFUNDS
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        We offer a 100% guarantee on our frames. You can return your frames for

        8. REGLAZE SERVICE
      </h2>
      <p class="text-t">
        We offer a reglaze service which allows you to use your existing glasses
        for your prescription and we will just provide the lenses. We treat your
        glasses with extreme care but occasionally, especially with older
        frames, they may break. This is more likely with plastic frames. The
        adjustment of the frames may also be affected. In these circumstances we
        cannot be liable for any costs that may be incurred to have the frame
        adjusted or replaced. We will usually return your original lenses
        although this cannot be guaranteed.
