    <p>
      JP Opticians Terms and Conditions of Purchase and Supply Please note that
      these terms and conditions do not affect your statutory consumer rights.
      1. THE MOST IMPORTANT TERM: Your sight is very important and there are
      circumstances where you should not buy prescription glasses online: Under
      16. If you are under 16 you should only be dispensed with glasses under
      the direct supervision of a Registered Optician. If your prescription is
      over 2 years old (1 year for over 70's) or your Optometrist has
      recommended an earlier sight test then you must have another sight test in
      order to have an up to date prescription before ordering.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">3. SUPPLY OF GOODS</h2>
    <p>
      You can make an order via our website. We will always try our best to
      ensure that all orders are fulfilled. However occasionally items might be
      out of stock or exceptionally might have been recently discontinued. In
      this case we will contact you. Although you will receive a confirmation
      email that your order has arrived, orders for prescription glasses are
      only accepted by us once they have been fully reviewed and authorised by a
      Registered Optician. We may need to contact you to discuss any concerns
      that we might have about your prescription. We may offer advice over the
      telephone or by email.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">4. DELIVERY</h2>
    <p>
      We will work on your order as soon as it is received. To give you an idea
      of delivery times please see below: Frames and single vision lenses in our
      immediate stock are usually dispatched in 1-3 days. Bifocal and non stock
      lenses are usually dispatched within a week but can take up to 14 days.
      Varifocals take longer because we need to post the frame to you first for
      measurement.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">5. PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      We collect data for the purpose of processing orders, contacting
      customers, and collecting feedback. As such, we will sometimes need to
      pass on data to third party data processors, for example passing your
      delivery address

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">6. SECURITY POLICY</h2>
    <p>
      Our Payment Service Provider is Opayo (formerly Sagepay) â€“ the largest

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">7. GUARANTEE/REFUNDS</h2>
    <p>
      We offer a 100% guarantee on our frames. You can return your frames for
      any reason whatsoever within 14 days for a refund. Any damage to the
      frames, such as scratches, should be reported within 7 days.
    </p>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mt-6">8. REGLAZE SERVICE</h2>
    <p>
      We offer a reglaze service which allows you to use your existing glasses
      for your prescription and we will just provide the lenses. We treat your
      glasses with extreme care but occasionally, especially with older frames,
      they may break. This is more likely with plastic frames. The adjustment of
      the frames may also be affected. In these circumstances we cannot be
      liable for any costs that may be incurred to have the frame adjusted or
      replaced. We will usually return your original lenses although this cannot
      be guaranteed.
