    - name: "Ken"
      text: "Ordered prescription lenses with Oakley frames on a Friday and they arrived at the door in perfect condition on the following Thursday, at a very reasonable price. £100+ cheaper than high street. Perfect."
    - name: "J Vincent"
      text: "Been after prescription sports sun glasses for a long time. Phoned this place, very helpful, knowledgable and professional. Ordered same day and turned up a few days later, exactly what I have been after. Thanks for the excellent advice and service."
    - name: "Alison"
      text: "I have to say the whole process was efficient, they were fast at answering emails, my glasses wear done on the day they received them and I had them the day after... Very impressed! Hugely cheaper than if I had them done at my opticians in town! I will definitely be back!"
    - name: "Laura"
      text: "I rarely leave reviews, but had to for Spex4less. My prescription sunglasses order turned out even better than I'd hoped. The frame is sturdy, and the lenses are perfect for my prescription. The same frame from a high street optician was quoted over £500, and I got it here for £200!"
    - name: "Alan"
      text: "I have a particular problem with my vision and after a recent visit to my optician he suggested that polarised prescription sunglasses would help me particularly whilst driving. I bought a pair as he suggested made up by Spex4less. The glasses fit was perfect and definitely an improvement for driving, thanks all round."

# FAQ Section
faq:
  title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
  questions:
    - question: "Can you turn regular glasses into prescription sunglasses?"
      answer: "Yes, you can turn your regular glasses into prescription sunglasses using our reglaze service. This service allows you to add tinted, prescription lenses to your existing frames, providing both clear vision and sun protection. You can choose from various tint options and even opt for polarised lenses to reduce glare. Our reglaze service makes it easy to transform your favourite glasses into stylish and functional prescription sunglasses."
    - question: "What colour tints can you provide?"
      answer: "We provide Grey, Brown and Green (G15) colour tints. Also, we are able to offer these in polarised options alongside Gold, Silver, Blue, Green and Red Mirror coatings."
    - question: "What's the difference between polarised and tinted lenses?"
      answer: "Tinted lenses simply reduce brightness, but polarised lenses go a step further by cutting glare from reflective surfaces like water, roads, or glass. If you drive frequently, spend time by the water, or want the best clarity in sunlight, polarised lenses are a great choice."
    - question: "Do you offer designer sunglasses?"
      answer: "Yes, we stock a wide range of designer sunglasses including brands like Ray-Ban, Oakley, Police, and more. You can buy them as they are or add your prescription for a fully customised pair."
    - question: "Are your sunglasses UV protected?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Every pair of sunglasses from Spex4Less includes 100% UVA and UVB protection as standard – even with prescription lenses. You'll never have to worry about eye damage from sun exposure."
