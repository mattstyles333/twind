    - name: "Ken"
      text: "Ordered prescription lenses with Oakley frames on a Friday and they arrived at the door in perfect condition on the following Thursday, at a very reasonable price. £100+ cheaper than high street. Perfect."
    - name: "J Vincent"
      text: "Been after prescription sports sun glasses for a long time. Phoned this place, very helpful, knowledgable and professional. Ordered same day and turned up a few days later, exactly what I have been after. Thanks for the excellent advice and service."
    - name: "Alison"
      text: "I have to say the whole process was efficient, they were fast at answering emails, my glasses wear done on the day they received them and I had them the day after... Very impressed! Hugely cheaper than if I had them done at my opticians in town! I will definitely be back!"
    - name: "Laura"
      text: "I rarely leave reviews, but had to for Spex4less. My prescription sunglasses order turned out even better than I'd hoped. The frame is sturdy, and the lenses are perfect for my prescription. The same frame from a high street optician was quoted over £500, and I got it here for £200!"
    - name: "Alan"
      text: "I have a particular problem with my vision and after a recent visit to my optician he suggested that polarised prescription sunglasses would help me particularly whilst driving. I bought a pair as he suggested made up by Spex4less. The glasses fit was perfect and definitely an improvement for driving, thanks all round."
