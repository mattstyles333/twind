          7.1 In this Section 7, we have summarised the rights that you have
          under data protection law. Some of the rights are complex, and not all
          of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you
          should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory
          authorities for a full explanation of these rights.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-2">
          7.2 Your principal rights under data protection law are:
        </li>
        <p class="ml-4 mt-2 leading-8">
          (a) the right to access;
          <br />(b) the right to rectification; <br />(c) the right to erasure;
          <br />(d) the right to restrict processing; <br />(e) the right to
          object to processing; <br />(f) the right to data portability;
          <br />(g) the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and
          <br />(h) the right to withdraw consent.

        <li class="mt-2">
          7.3 You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process
          your personal data and, where we do, access to the personal data,
          together with certain additional information. That additional
          information includes details of the purposes of the processing, the
          categories of personal data concerned and the recipients of the
          personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not
          affected, we will supply to you a copy of your personal data. The
          first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional copies may
          be subject to a reasonable fee.

          7.4 You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you
          rectified and, taking into account the purposes of the processing, to
          have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

        <li class="mt-2">
          7.5 In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your
          personal data without undue delay. Those circumstances include: the
          personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for
          which they were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent
          to consent-based processing; you object to the processing under
          certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for
          direct marketing purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully
          processed. However, there are exclusions of the right to erasure. The
          general exclusions include where processing is necessary for:
          exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
          compliance with a legal obligation; or the establishment, exercise or
          defence of legal claims.

        <li class="mt-2">
          7.6 In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the
          processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest
          the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you
          oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes
          of our processing, but you require personal data for the
          establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have
          objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection.
          Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to
          store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it:
          with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal
          claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal
          person; or for reasons of important public interest.

          is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public
          interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or
          the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third

          grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
