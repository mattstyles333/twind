      What Are Varifocal Glasses?
    </h2>
    <p class="mx-auto mt-6 text-left text-xl leading-relaxed lg:text-center">
      A varifocal lens - often referred to as progressive glasses - is a marvel
      of modern optics, offering multiple focal points all in the same lens
      design. With just one pair of glasses, varifocal lenses are able to
      seamlessly merge a reading prescription, a distance prescription, and
      intermediate vision clarity all into one lens. At Spex4Less, we provide a
      diverse range of the best varifocal glasses tailored to all your vision
      needs, using the most accurate online fitting system.

<!-- How Do Varifocal Lenses Work? -->

      How Do Varifocal Lenses Work?
    </h5>
    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      Put simply, varifocal lenses work by layering different prescriptions in a
      methodic way. The top part of the varifocal lens is for distance vision,
      the middle is for intermediate distances like your computer screen, and
      the bottom is for close-up tasks like reading. The transition between
      these zones is smooth and gradual, providing a natural viewing experience.
      You can even use varifocal lenses for
      <a href="/sunglasses" class="text-link">Prescription Sunglasses</a>, so
      you can maintain continuity between your shades and your day-to-day
      glasses.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      So whether you're looking for designer frames, a specific varifocal lens
      type, or a particular coating, we've got you covered. Each pair of glasses
      is glazed with top-quality lenses, and our
      <a href="/guarantee" class="text-link">100% satisfaction guarantee</a>
      ensures that you can experience the benefits of varifocal glasses -
      whether it's your first pair or not - completely risk free.

          Varifocal lenses offer a significant advantage over single-vision
          lenses by offering various focal points, as opposed to singles which
          correct for only one distance. With varifocals, you eliminate the
          hassle of constantly switching between different pairs of glasses.
          Plus, they provide a seamless transition between near, intermediate,
          and distance vision, enhancing your overall visual comfort and
          convenience.

<!-- Frame Depth Matters for Varifocals -->
<section class="dark:bg-p dark:text-gray-200">
  <div class="container mx-auto px-6 py-12">
    <h5
      class="text-left text-3xl font-bold text-slate-800 dark:text-gray-300 leading-snug"
    >
      Why Frame Depth Matters for Varifocals
    </h5>
    <p class="mt-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 dark:text-gray-200">
      Choosing the right frame depth is crucial for getting the most out of your
      varifocal lenses. While more expensive varifocal lenses are often marketed
      as superior, a deeper frame can actually provide a better visual
      experience compared to a shallower frame. Frames with a depth greater than
      30mm give more room for the different focal zones to work effectively,
      providing a smoother and more comfortable transition between distance,
      intermediate, and near vision.
