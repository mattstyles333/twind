              Anti-Reflective Coating
            </h5>
            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              This coating eliminates surface reflections on a lens, enabling
              more light transmission, enhancing vision, reducing eye strain,
              and improving the aesthetics of glasses. An anti-reflective coat
              also enhances driver safety by minimizing glare from streetlights
              or headlights, leading to faster recognition of road hazards,
              especially at night.

            </h5>
            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              Blue light exists in both natural daylight and electronic devices
              like computers, smartphones, TVs, and strip lights. With its short
              wavelength, blue light easily enters the eyes, leading to
              potential issues like retinal damage, eye strain, and fatigue.

              UV and Durable+ Coating

            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              Our UV and Durable+ coating offers a combination of UV protection
              and scratch resistance. Harmful UV rays from sunlight are
              countered by this coating, enhancing eye safety. Moreover, it
              includes a layer that resists scratches, maintaining the lens
              quality amid everyday use.

              Anti-Fogging Coating
            </h5>
            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              An anti-fog coating absorbs moisture from warm air on lenses,
              which helps prevent them from fogging up. This lens coating is
              particularly useful for keeping your glasses clear and steam-free
              when you are wearing a mask, drinking a hot drink, cooking, or
              taking part in outdoor activities.

              Honeycomb Coating
            </h5>

            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              Introducing honeycomb lenses: Reduce glare by redirecting light
              from all angles. Advanced anti-reflective coating enhances night
              driving, minimizes fatigue, and provides UV protection. Sharper
              vision, water/oil repellence, low maintenance. Ideal for
              low-light, combating fatigue, enhancing clarity for safer
              nighttime driving.

              Photochromic Coating
            </h5>
            <p class="ark:text-gray-400 mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700">
              Photochromic lenses adjust their color based on atmospheric light
              brightness. They darken with increased UV exposure. This coating
              suits those frequently transitioning between indoor and outdoor
              settings. However, inside a vehicle with lower UV, their darkening
              ability decreases, so they aren't suitable for driving.
